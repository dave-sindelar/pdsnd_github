### Date created
**August 20, 2020**

### Project Title
**The Bikeshare Statistics Project**

### Description
This was written as part of the Udacity Data Science course on python programming.  The challenge was to create a module that would produce statistics across several files of bikeshare data. The user can specify the area of coverage, and select among options to filter the data.

### Files used
Udacity provided three files to be used for this project:
* *chicago.csv*
* *new_york_city.csv*
* *washington.csv*

### Credits
The basic format of the module was supplied by https://www.udacity.com/, and both https://docs.python.org/3/ and https://www.w3schools.com/ provided information that helped me to shape the code.

### Possible future enhancements of code
* Consider gui screens for the input of data.
* Format the longer float values, especially in the hours/seconds section
